# tictactoe-roli
Allows the user to play Tic Tac Toe against a quantum computer, using a Roli board. There are 3 different modes the quantum computer can use to play:

- Basic - this simply uses gate rotations to choose the best moves
- Grover - this uses the famous Grover's Search Algorithm to select a move
- SVM - this uses a quantum support vector machine to calculate the next move
